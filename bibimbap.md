#Bi Bim Bap

For us, bim bim bap starts with bacon, and short rib strips. We marinate the meat with soy sauce, brown sugar, garlic, ginger, green onions, sesame oil and seeds. Then cook korean rice and prepare greens. we alternate between Japanese style sesame, spinach or mustard greens. Use a Dolset stone hot pot and warm on burner. Coconut oil and Gojuchang (korean fermented sweet chili paste) in the stone pot. mix, throw on rice, layer kimchi and greens, surrounded by meat. Top with a poached egg, preference... duck

Directions:

- Make short grain Asian rice. 
- Make a sweet asian marinate (soy, mirin, brown sugar, salt, sesame oil... to taste). 
- Marinate then fry up pork belly or bacon. 
- Use a Dolset stone pan or big ceramic frying pan to fry up the rice with some oil, some gochuchang, and some garlic. 

Once the rice is coated, then let it sit crisping in the bottom of the pan. Layer rice, sesame spinich, meat, pickles/kimchi/etc, duck egg. Enjoy
