#Mike's Ramen

build the broth.  I would start with garlic cloves (whole), some kombu, the left over pork salt, pepper.  boil it up and slow boil for an hour or so.  take the kombu out about 25 mins in<p>

I use chicken stock (or that turkey you have)
I also use a couple packs of dashi powder
those vary in quality<p>

but all else fails, garlic, turkey broth and pork.  remove pork and then immersion blend the rest<p>

boil ramen , poach egg... labor of love
