#Myob's Turkish Dip for Manly Men

See warning after recipe!

Can of black olives<br>
Jar of green olives<br>
Entire clove of fresh garlic, two if you really hate people<br>
One medium sized red onion, sweet vidalia for pansy version<br>
Half cup red wine vinegar<br>
Two tablespoons high test olive oil<br> 

Mince everything minceable<br>
Combine everything<br>
Chill for a couple hours 

Using corn chips or crackers shovel into mouth, one cup per person, serves 4-6 depending on size of stuff.

This stuff is HAZARDOUS!!!

"If you made it right, most people will not eat it. It burns. It stinks. It's fucking awesome, and you WILL SMELL LIKE A DYING STEPPE PONY FOR 3 DAYS. I'm not joking and the tagged people can chime in. This is DANGEROUS in the wrong professional environment. If you are employed, never eat on a Sunday.  You have been warned.

I discovered this stuff in Turkey during GW1 and eat it at least annually, but never more than twice because Beth has threatened me over it." - Brian MYOB
