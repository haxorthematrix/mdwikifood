#Brisket Mopping Sauce

This recipe starts out with one 12 ounce bottle of beer. You can substitute 3/4 cup of wine, apple juice or apple cider for the beer, but it needs to be combined with an equal amount of water.<p>

To the beer, or your substitute, add:<p>

2 tablespoons of cider vinegar,<br>
1 tablespoon of paprika,<br>
1 tablespoon of Frank's Red Hot Sauce,<br>
1 teaspoon (or to taste) of cayenne powder,<br>
1 teaspoon black pepper,<br>
1 teaspoon of kosher salt,<br>
2 crushed cloves of garlic,<br>
and one medium chopped onion.<p>

(You will also need 1/4 cup of light vegetable oil, but this gets added later, right before this basting liquid is used.)
