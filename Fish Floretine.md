This easy Fish Florentine recipe, made with a pan seared firm white fish served on a creamy bed of spinach feels like something you would order out in a fancy restaurant!

INGREDIENTS:
4 (5 oz) thick pieces of skinless white firm fish fillet (such as grouper, bass or halibut)
1 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
1 tablespoon salted butter
1 cup red bell pepper chopped
2 cloves garlic minced
9 ounces fresh baby spinach (from two bags)
2 ounces 1/3 less fat cream cheese (I like Philadelphia)
¼ cup half & half cream
3 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
kosher salt
fresh black pepper
DIRECTIONS:

In a large skillet over medium heat add 1/2 tablespoon of olive oil and 1/2 tablespoon of butter, red bell pepper and garlic and cook for about 4 minutes.
Add spinach season with a pinch of salt and pepper mix until the spinach wilts down.
Add cream cheese, half & half and parmesan cheese mix well until cream cheese is melted and resembles creamed spinach.
Heat a separate skillet on medium high heat, add remaining oil and butter.
Season fish on both sides with salt and pepper and place on the hot pan.
Cook 6 minutes on first side and flip fish over and cook other side an additional 5 minutes, until cooked through and browned.
Divide the spinach mixture on the bottom of each plate and top with piece of fish.
