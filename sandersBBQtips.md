#Colonel Sanders BBQ Tips

Misc:<p>
* Keep your cooking chamber a humid environment by placing a water pan in there and keeping it at least half full. 

Pulled Pork:<p>
* I try to trim the fat cap down fairly thin (1/8 or so). I want the rub to get into the meat as much as possible.

* I cook it until about ~200.  
* Salt the meat 12-16 hours before you cook it. A liberal coating of salt all over the meat.  
* Rub the meat right before it goes on.
* Cook fat side up.
* It helps to tie it with butcher twine, but isn’t necessary.
* You’ll know its cooked well with the bone pulls clean from the meat. If its mushy you went too long if it pulls too tight you didn’t go long enough. 

Brisket:<p>

* Brisket is one of the hardest things to cook perfectly on a smoker. There is little tolerance for temperature variation. Too long and its mush, too short and its tough as nails. 
* I cook it until it is about 160-165 and wrap it in foil. Then I cook it until 203. 
* You have to let the brisket rest for at least a couple of hours before you cut into it. This is important with beef. I wrap it in butcher paper, then wrap it in a towel and put it in a cooler. 
* Watch this guys videos on brisket. Really simple stuff: https://www.youtube.com/user/BBQwithFranklin
* I keep it simple and season with salt and pepper for the rub. The beef speaks for itself. 
* The most important part of brisket is cutting it right. If you don’t cut it right, it will be tough as nails. You should be able to find videos of this. 

Duck:<p>

* Brining a duck is key. 
* It’s important to cook the duck at lower temp (225) so the fat renders well. Ducks is VERY fatty. Even so, you’ll probably end up with a lot of excess fat. I save it and use it with other stuff.
* With duck I try to keep it pretty simple. Duck has great flavor on its own so it doesn’t need too much pomp and circumstance.
