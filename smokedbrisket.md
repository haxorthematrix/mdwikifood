#Smoked Brisket

Unpack the brisket and let it drain in the sink for five minutes or so. Trim the fat so it's about one-half inch thick, and then score the fat, cutting one-inch squares, and just down to the meat. You have a some options now. You can marinate the brisket, rub it down with a spicy dry rub, or do both. Use one of my brisket marinade recipes or brisket rub recipes , or use one of your own. The point is, you need to know how to smoke a brisket with flavor and a spicy kick.

##Marinating Brisket

Marinating is easy. Mix up your marinade, and pour it over the brisket. Make sure to use a non-reactive container…glass, plastic, or stainless steel. If the brisket isn't totally submerged, turn it over every couple of hours. A large plastic food storage bag makes a great marinating container, too.

You can use an injector to pump some of the marinade into the brisket. I usually pump a little marinade under the fat layer…no more than one-quarter cup into the entire brisket.
When smokin’ time arrives, let the excess marinade drain from the brisket. For extra flavor, shake on some dry rub or pepper. When I use my water smoker, I pour the leftover marinade into the water pan to give the brisket more flavor as it merrily smokes.
Dry Rub The Brisket

To dry rub a brisket, you rub it, wrap it, rest it, and smoke it. After the brisket has drained, place it in large pan. I will use anywhere from one-half to one full cup of dry rub on a brisket, depending on its size and the level of flavor I want.
Rub the spice mix onto the brisket and into the scores. I usually turn the brisket a few times, hitting each side twice. Wrap the rub-coated brisket in plastic wrap, put it into the cleaned pan and refrigerate it overnight. Letting it rest for two days will get the flavor deeper into the meat. After resting, unwrap it and put it into the smoker. There's quite a bit to knowing how to smoke a brisket.

##Brisket Smoking Wood

Allrighty then. We've bought it and seasoned it…now it's time to learn how to smoke a brisket. Beef is a flavorful meat, and with the additional seasoning flavors to boot, it'll take a good dose of smoke to balance it all out. My personal preference is white oak for smoke. I'll use hickory if I don't have the oak. Use one of these, or your own favorite. Smoke for the flavor you want.

##Low and Slow

Brisket needs low and slow smoker cooking to reach its ultimate taste and texture. A rule of thumb is that brisket needs one hour per pound at 220 degrees Fahrenheit. It could take more or less time, depending on the smoker temperature and the quality of the brisket.

I've used an vertical water smoker with excellent results. The steam from the water pan prevents the brisket from drying. When I smoke brisket on a pit smoker, I wrap it in foil after four or five hours to keep it from drying out.
At this point, it can be finished off in the smoker, or put it into an oven set at 220 degrees. (Some may call this cheating, but after it's wrapped in foil, it really doesn't matter.)

When the brisket reaches an internal temperature of 190-200 degrees, it should be fork tender and ready to eat. Take it from the smoker (or oven) and let it rest for at least 30 minutes to let the juices redistribute throughout the meat.
