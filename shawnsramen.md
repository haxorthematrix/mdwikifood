Overall  Ingredients for soup and tare:
 
* 8 lbs total in bones (I used half femurs, half neck bones. All neck will work in a pinch)
* About .8lbs fatback. (10% the weight of the bones).
* 5 3 inch by 3 inch squares of kombu
* ¾ cup dried niboshi
* 1 tbs sesame oil
* 1 cup loosely packed bonito
* ¼ cup sake
* ¼ cup mirin
* 1 cup soy sauce (I use a combination of usukuchi, good ol’ standard kikkoman, and a white soy sauce)
* Salt to taste
* 5 Spice
* Pork Belly
* Soy Sauce


##Broth
Ingredients: (Makes maybe 8 qrts of stock total)<p>

8 lbs total in bones (I used half femurs, half neck bones. All neck will work in a pinch)
About .8lbs fatback. (10% the weight of the bones).

Steps:<br>
Before any cooking, soak the bones in cold water in a large, non-reactive vessel, for at least 6 hours, and up to 24 hours. (I use a large plastic container).

The night before you want your broth ready, drain the bones, add them to a pot with fresh water covering them by 2 inches, and bring to a boil over high heat.

Drop the heat to medium, and blanch the bones, at a simmer, for 15-30 minutes, or until little to no scum rises.

Strain the bones again, and scrub away any black material, such as coagulated blood, from the bones and pot.

Return the bones to the pot. Add fresh water, and add in the fatback. If doing the night before, bring this to a boil, then down to the lowest setting on your stove, and cover. Then go to bed. If not, continue to step 7.

In the morning, bring the pot back up to a full boil, then back down to the lowest setting possible to mantain that jostling boil while covered. (For me, this is medium on my stove)

Depending on when you started cooking, continue to boil the broth for 12-18 hours, or until desired consistency and color is reached, meat has completely separated and broken down in the broth, and fatback pieces have mostly melted. Optionally, you can stir every 1-2 hours just to check up on things and promote more churning. 
Please feel free to add back water if the level gets too low.

Once cooked to your liking, strain the broth, discarding the solids, and reserve broth until needed over low heat. This broth keeps for around a week in the fridge.


##Tare
Cover the kombu with water enough to cover. Let sit overnight, or at least 3 hours, in the fridge.

When ready, add sesame oil to a medium sauce pan over medium heat.

When oil is shimmering, toss in the niboshi, sauteeing in the oil for 40 seconds to a minute, or until brown and fragrant. Try not to get this too hot, as bitter flavors might develop if the fish is overheated.

Add the kombu and kombu’s soaking liquid. Bring to 176 degrees (shoutouts to Ivan Orkin for this temp).

Remove the kombu, add the bonito, and steep the niboshi and bonito in this liquid at 176 for 10 minutes.

Strain broth, and reserve while making soy base.

In the pot, add in the mirin and sake, and cook at a boil to remove the alcohol, around 5 minutes.

Add in the soy sauce, and bring to 176 again. Let sit at this temp for a few minutes to concentrate.

Add in an equal part of the fish broth made earlier. Season with salt until quite salty (like, to the point that you’d go “WOW this is almost too salty for me to handle, but damn it’s nice).

Done. Taste it with your broth and adjust as needed. Maybe it needs more soy? Maybe it needs more salt? Maybe some extra umami. Only you can judge.

##Noodles
Hakata noodles are low moisture, low protein, lower alkalinity. The recipe has been adjusted to fit this; I’ve played around with making a true Hakata noodle, but hydration for those is around 22%. At home, this is almost impossible to manage. So the below recipe is more in line with other regions of Kyushu, but it pairs nicely. More taut than a standard noodle, and less alkaline.
Also… feel free to buy sun noodles for this. Seriously, noodles are hard. And Tonkotsu is a time consuming endeavor.

For one portion (measure everything by weight):<p>

* 99 g Bread flour
* 1 g vital wheat gluten
* 36 g water
* 1 g baked soda
* 1 g salt

Steps:

Add baked soda and salt to the water, dissolve completely. I like to add one at a time, it seems like the baked soda dissolves better if added prior to the salt.

In the food processor, add your wheat gluten and flour. Pulse a few times to combine the two.

While running the food processor, add your water mixture slowly, in an even stream. Occasionally, stop to scrape the sides down. You know you're set when you have tiny grain like pieces.

Cover the food processor and let this rest for 30 minutes. This gives the flour granules time to fully absorb the water and alkaline salts.

Knead it. I used to throw the mix into a plastic bag and step on it repeatedly, which simulates the kneading process used in an industrial setting. Currently I use an electric pasta machine to sheet the dough, going through the largest setting, then the 2nd, then the 3rd, then folding and repassing through the largest setting. I repass two to three times, or until I notice the dough is making the machine work really hard. I also like to fold the dough the same direction each time. Some articles I read suggested this kept the gluten strands running in the same direction, which promotes better texture. You'll notice interesting horizontal lines running along the length of your dough if you do it right.

When smooth, cover with plastic, and rest at room temp for an hour. This gives the gluten time to relax, and “ripens” the dough.

Pull out your dough. Portion into workable sizes (around one serving's worth), and roll out to desired thickness, using potato starch as you go to prevent sticking. Do this with a pasta machine, it is borderline impossible without a machine. An electric one will save you an incredible amount of effort.

Cut your noodles to your desired thickness. I like mine rather thin for tonkotsu, but you rule your ramen.


Store for up to 2 days in the fridge, or indefinitely in the freezer.

Aroma oil:<p>

This aroma oil for this bowl, in my opinion, is completely optional. In fact, I might recommend not adding it this go around, just to enjoy the pure pork pleasure. But it’s simple as usual.

Melt a half cup of lard. Add in a handful of garlic cloves, and cook over low heat, until the garlic is golden. Strain.

Other toppings are typical. Soft boiled steeped egg, chashu, green onion, a little ground black pepper, some sliced woodear mushroom (just reconstituted per package instructions), maybe some benishoga if wanted. 

##Chashu

* 2 pound slab of boneless pork belly, skin-on
* 1/2 cup soy sauce
* 1 cup sake
* 1 cup mirin
* 1/2 cup sugar
* 6 scallions, roughly chopped
* 6 whole garlic cloves
* One 2-inch knob ginger, roughly sliced
* 1 whole shallot, split in half (skin on)

Directions:<p>

Lay pork belly on cutting board and roll up lengthwise, with skin facing out.

Using butchers twine, tightly secure pork belly at 3/4-inch intervals.

Preheat oven to 275°F. Heat 1 cup water, soy sauce, sake, mirin, sugar, scallions, garlic, ginger, and shallot in a medium saucepan over high heat until boiling. Add pork belly (it won't be submerged). Cover with a lid left slightly ajar. Transfer to oven and cook, turning pork occasionally, until pork is fully tender and a cake tester or thin knife inserted into its center meets little resistance, 3 to 4 hours. Transfer contents to a sealed container and refrigerate until completely cool.

When ready to serve, remove pork belly and strain broth. Reserve broth for another use (like making ajitsuke tamago). Slice pork belly into thin rounds (it might help to cut it in half lengthwise first).

Reheat pork belly slices in soup broth with noodles and other garnishes. Alternatively, heat a small amount of reserved broth in a skillet and heat pork slices in broth until hot or reheat with a blowtorch, charring its surface. Serve.

##Japanese Ramen Eggs Recipe

Ingredients:

* Water, for boiling
* 1 tablespoon baking soda
* 6 eggs, at room temperature

Seasoning Sauce:

* 50 ml cup Japanese tsuyu or soup base (such as Mizkan Bonito-Flavored Soup Base)
* 50 ml cooking sake
* 25 ml soy sauce or Tamari soy sauce
* 25ml mirin

Directions:<p>

Combine the water and baking soda in the pot and bring the water to boil. The water level must be deep enough to cover all eggs. When the water boils, add the eggs and cook for 7 minutes.

In a separate pan add all the ingredients in Seasoning Sauce together. Bring the sauce the boil, then remove from the heat and let cool.

When your eggs are done cooking, plunge them into ice water and leave to sit for 5 minutes. Carefully peel off the shells, while the eggs are still in the water. Make sure you remove the membrane covering the egg white.

In a container or a bag, add the Seasoning Sauce and the eggs. Gently rotate the eggs to make sure they’re evenly covered in the sauce, then leave to stand overnight, or 1 or 2 days in the fridge. When they are ready to serve, slice into halves and serve with ramen or eat as a snack.

Cook’s Notes:

I used room temperature eggs. The eggs are best after 2 days in the fridge.

Baking soda helps with the peeling of the eggs so your ramen eggs will be pretty and nice!

##Tsuyu Sauce:

Ingredients:<p>

* 1 cup dashi
* 1/4 cup soy sauce
* 1/4 cup mirin

Directions:<p>

Combine the dashi, soy sauce, and mirin in an airtight container, shake to combine and refrigerate until cold, approximately 1 hour. Serve with soba noodles.

NOTE: Use this for dashi: https://kobikitchen.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/dashib-640.jpg?w=640
