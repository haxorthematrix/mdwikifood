Jimmy's gin

Cheap Ass Vodka + Juniper berries, Cardamom pods, cinnamon stick, coriander seed, bay leaf, fennel, orange peel == Awesome and inexpensive Gin.

Let it sit for two days in 750ml, then strain it and drop 4 sticks of charred American oak in it... Begin drinking after 1 day of oaking... But leave them in there 

1 bottle of scary bad vodka
2 TB Juniper berries 
1 tsp peppercorns (szechuan are unique)
2 torn bay leaves 
2 smashed cardamom pods
1 cinnamon stick
1 TB citrus peel, no rind (lemon and orange work best)
Coriander seeds
(Optional but tasty: rose petals, lemongrass, lavender)
