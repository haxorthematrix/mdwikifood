#Roasted Turkey

Preheat oven to 450, drop to 350 on put in oven.  Turkey covered in roasting pan with wire rack

12 minutes a LB for unstuffed, 15 per stuffed.  Last time we used apples, oranges and drid cranberries to stuff, and was discarded.

Uncover the last 45 minutes or so to crisp up the skin.  Seep thermometer should read 180 to be done.  Let sit 10-15 out of the oven th rest.

Also, gravy was a disaster.  Back to the drawing board on that one.
